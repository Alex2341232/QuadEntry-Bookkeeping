# 🌍 QuadLedger – Sustainability-Integrated Accounting App

**QuadLedger** is a prototype web application developed as part of a master's dissertation on the future of accounting. The app brings to life a new conceptual model called **Quad-Entry Bookkeeping**, which introduces a fourth ledger entry to account for the **environmental and social impact** of financial transactions.

## 🎓 Academic Context

This application is part of the practical contribution to the dissertation:

> **Title:** Rethinking Accounting: The Emergence of Quad-Entry Bookkeeping  
> **Author:** Alexandru Gradinaru
> **Institution:** Bucharest University of Economic Studies (ASE)  
> **Year:** 2025

## 💡 What It Does

- 📄 **Invoice Upload**  
  Upload a PDF or image of a financial invoice.

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Parsing**  
  The system extracts key data using OpenAI (e.g., supplier, date, amount).

- 🧾 **Auto-Generated Ledger Entries**  
  Based on the invoice, the app deduces the Debit and Credit entries.

- 🔐 **Immutable Transaction Record**  
  Each invoice is time-stamped and stored in a tamper-proof (simulated blockchain) ledger.

- 🌱 **Impact Ledger (Fourth Entry)**  
  Users input ESG data:
  - CO₂ emissions  
  - Water usage  
  - Labor compliance  
  - Waste recycling

- 📊 **Dashboard**  
  See recent entries, download reports, and analyze sustainability impact.
